# brc-cyberinfrastructure

This repository contains components created for researchers to scale and automate scientific investigation. These components are exemplars that utilize multiple languages, SDKs and technologies and as such the repository cannot be cloned and built in the same way that a single app is constructed. Researchers will be directed to specific files that they will download, modify and employ in their environment.

The hierarchy is organic, based on what has been created to date. It will evolve as the scope of the cyberinfrastructure engineer expands over time.
